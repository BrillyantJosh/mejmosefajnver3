/**
 * UTXO consolidation planning — the shared, pure rules.
 *
 * Imported by BOTH the page (src/pages/WalletConsolidate.tsx) and the server
 * (server/routes/functions.ts → POST /consolidate-wallet) so the two can never
 * disagree about what is spendable. No imports, no browser or node APIs.
 *
 * A consolidation spends n inputs of one address into ONE output back to the
 * same address, so it removes exactly (n − 1) UTXOs and costs fee(n).
 *
 * Two facts drive everything here:
 *
 *  1. Each extra input costs MARGINAL (27,000) in fee. Dust is worth far less
 *     than that, so a batch is paid for by its largest UTXOs, not its count.
 *
 *  2. Viability is NOT monotone in n. Adding an input raises the requirement by
 *     27,000 while adding only its own value, but a bigger n can still succeed
 *     where a smaller one failed — five UTXOs of 28,750 fail at n = 2, 3 and 4
 *     and succeed at n = 5. So the size must be found by scanning DOWNWARD from
 *     the largest affordable size; a "grow while it still fits" loop silently
 *     reports such a wallet as impossible.
