/**
 * THE FIRMS THAT NOW BUY LANA — what GET /api/buying-dealers answers, and what
 * the Sell pages of the Lana Discount and BEF modules (/discount/sell,
 * /bef/sell) name instead of sending anyone to lana.discount/offer.
 *
 * On 8 Oct 2026 Brilly closed selling LANA on lana.discount: "napiši da sta
 * odkup Lan prevzela firme Krog Menjave ali Ravena Plus (beri iz Relayjev in
 * naj se uporabniki pri enem od podjetji registrirajo)" — and the same day,
 * for this app: "naredi ta isti popravek za prodajo tudi na strani
 * https://app.mejmosefajn.org/discount/sell preko katere uporabniki isto jih
 * preusmer na ta podjetja" (Brilly, 8. 10. 2026). So this is lana.discount's
 * reader (lana-coin-discount server/lib/buyingDealers.ts, 1996af0), copied
 * with its rule, its timings and its answer unchanged; only these comments
 * and the import of the database handle (./buyingDealersShared.ts) differ.
 *
 * The firms are not typed in here. They are the BEF dealers whose own signed
 * KIND 30972 profile says they buy LANA (content.roles includes "buys"),
 * admitted by exactly the rule BEF Explorer lists its companies by
 * (./befDealers/dealers.ts), read from the relays the verified stored KIND
 * 38888 publishes (./befDealers/systemParams.ts) — never from the `relays`
 * column, never from the boot seed.
 *
 * MEMORY ONLY. No table, no write: one answer is kept in this process, the
 * last GOOD read.
 *
 *   fresh    a good read under DEALER_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS old (10 minutes) is
 *            answered as it is;
 *   stale    an older one is answered at once, and one read starts behind it
 *            (never two at a time, and after a failed read not again for
 *            RETRY_AFTER_FAILURE_MS);
 *   too old  one older than MAX_ANSWER_AGE_MS (20 minutes) is not served as it
 *            is: GET /api/buying-dealers waits for the read behind it, at most
 *            `maxWaitMs`, exactly as on a cold start — unless the read before
 *            it failed, when waiting would only delay the same stale answer;
 *   cold     with no good read yet, a caller may wait for the read in flight
 *            up to `maxWaitMs`, and is otherwise answered "unknown" with no
 *            firm at all.
 *
 * Freshness does not wait for a visitor. BEF Explorer reads on its heartbeat;
 * here the process-wide reader (./buyingDealersShared.ts, `keepFresh`) checks
 * every KEEP_FRESH_TICK_MS from the first time it is asked, and reads when a
 * read is due — so the firms a page names are at most one read cycle old
 * while the relays answer. The timer never keeps the process alive.
 *
 * A read that reached no relay, or found no verified KIND 38888, decides
 * nothing: the last good answer stays, marked stale since then — except a
 * dealer none of whose admins is a reliable person in the stored KIND 38888
 * any more, which goes (the BEF rule). A read that did answer replaces the
 * answer, an empty list included — with ONE difference from BEF Explorer's
 * directory. There a site that does not answer lists nothing that time; here
 * the number of firms picks the sentence ("register with this company"), so a
 * firm missing for one slow answer would be a false statement on the page. A
 * dealer the last good read listed, taken off ONLY because its own site did
 * not answer or no relay returned its profile, and still backed by a reliable
 * person in the KIND 38888, is kept from that read — the answer marked stale
 * since then — for at most HOLD_UNCONFIRMED_MS (an hour). Every real refusal
 * still takes it off at once: retired, not in its site's file, no reliable
 * admin, another website, no roles. The rule in ./befDealers/dealers.ts is not
 * touched; removedBySilence() reads its sentences, and
 * server/test/buyingDealers.test.ts fails if one of them changes.
 *
 * Nothing here sells, signs or moves LANA: the page only names the firms and
 * links to their own sites. When the answer is "unknown" the page still says
 * selling moved and points at BEF Explorer's list of companies.
