/**
 * THE DEALERS WHO BUY LANA — read from Nostr exactly as BEF Explorer reads its
 * directory, so MejmoSefajn never names a firm BEF Explorer would not list.
 *
 * A PORT of bef-explorer/server/lib/dealers.ts (a7d3702), as lana.discount
 * made it (lana-coin-discount 1996af0) and copied here unchanged but for these
 * comments: both apps name the same firms by the same rule. The rule is theirs,
 * word for word (kinds.json 30972 directory_reader_profile, Brilly 5 Oct
 * 2026): a dealer is listed when
 *
 *   1. its profile is signed by a key its OWN website lists for that slug in
 *      https://<host>/.well-known/bef-dealer.json (./wellKnown.ts asks it, and
 *      only it), the host taken from the profile's website, and
 *   2. at least one admin that host lists for the slug is a reliable person in
 *      the signed KIND 38888 (reliable_person) AND that reliable person has
 *      signed a profile of the slug naming that host — any version, not only
 *      the newest. A site can write anyone's key into its file; the signature
 *      is the consent;
 *
 * and its newest valid profile (newest created_at, a tie to the lowest id,
 * nothing more than 15 minutes ahead) is active and states its roles.
 *
 * HOW IT IS READ, unchanged: (a) the profiles the reliable people signed; (b)
 * the dealer file of each host one of THOSE names (and each host listed last
 * time) — no stranger chooses which sites are asked; (c) every version of
 * those dealers by the keys their sites list; (d) each (host, slug) decided
 * anew. A site that does not answer lists nothing that time, and neither does
 * a profile no relay returned. Only a read no relay answered — or with no
 * verified KIND 38888 — decides nothing.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IN THE PORT, and only this:
 *
 *   - refreshDealers(db) became readDealers(params, held): no database. BEF
 *     Explorer keeps a mirror table; this app keeps the last good answer
 *     in memory (../buyingDealers.ts) and hands its dealers back in as `held`,
 *     where BEF read `SELECT … FROM bef_dealers WHERE listed = 1`. Each
 *     `write.run` became a push onto `listed`; each `unlist`/`markStale` a line
 *     in the answer. The decision in step d is the original, refusal reasons
 *     and all.
 *   - The KIND 38888 comes in verified (./systemParams.ts): its relays and its
 *     reliable people are read from the signed event itself, never from a
 *     column.
 *   - What is kept of a listed dealer is its public facts only: name, website,
 *     roles, the keys its site lists, which event and when. No bank account,
 *     owner, director, telephone, registration number or wallet.
 *
 * Which of the listed dealers BUY is the caller's question (../buyingDealers.ts):
 * the held list keeps every listed dealer, because a seller-only firm today
 * may state "buys" tomorrow, and BEF's rule asks a held host again first.
